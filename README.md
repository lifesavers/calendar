Let's Put the Gregorian, Julian Calendar in the Grave this Year
=======================================================================================

##mod12(365)=5 or mod13(365)=1?##

Only an idiotes would base their Solar Calendar off mod 12, when they could mod 13 it instead. Mod 13 Yields Remainder 1; Mod 12 Yields Remainder 5. On the lifesaver labs Calendar, the 20th of every month, for the rest of time, will be the equivalent of a Friday. We won't call it "Friday", but it will always be a Friday. 

![lifesaver labs, pax-mod Calendar](https://github.com/lifesavers/calendar/blob/master/webassets/KohlbergLL36PaxMCalendar.png?raw=true)


Why⁵ wouldn't You want to be able to anchor each day of the month to a specific weekday?  For the next 1000 Years, do We / we really want to pitch our tent within the Calendrical "Base Camp" of Mod 12 when we can have the much simpler, far more memory-stable Mod 13 Pax Calendar as our Calendar's "Base Camp""?###

Sunday the 1st, Saturday the 28th, and Friday the 13th, Forever
----------------------------------------------------------------
On the Julian Calendar, if i said to You, "Let's meet on the 20th next month", You and i will have to look up what day of the week that is.  Why do we do that to Ourselves when better options exist? Every 6th, 20th, 27th, and yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.. every 13th will always be a Friday. Always. Every Month will have a "Friday the 13th". Forever! And no, this isn't a joke. This is a necessary outcome of hosting the 1st on Sunday, the 2nd (He²) on Monday, the 10th (Ne¹⁰) on Tuesday, the 18th (Ar¹⁸) on Friendsday, Wednesday, and the 28th on a Saturday. For the 1st of the Month to be a Sunday, and the 28th of every Month to be a Saturday, Every Month is going to always include, forever, a Friday the 13th.

So, if Your friend or colleague or parent or spouse or child or boss says to You, "Let's meet on the 13th", You'll know that means Friday, and You'll be able to say when You're available (or not) a lot more easily, without having to pull out Your Pocket Calendar to find out what day of the week that is. How many screwups happen in our lives because we don't have the dates tied down very simply to instantly recognizable and recalled weekdays?

Never Forget Your Wedding Anniversary⁵, and Celebrate Your Birthday Twice
--------------------------------------
lifesaver labs, the Pax-modified Calendar, is a robust simplification of the Calendar that stops the swirling confusion of a "Remainder 5" Shift at the end of every Year. The "Remainder 5" forces so much "week-to-week redshift" that we all suffer from analytically unequal months (28 - 31, deranging month estimates by as much as 10%), unpredictable weekday month kickoffs, and unstable anniversary⁵ memories. Your Wedding Anniversary will always fall on the same day of the week forever on the lifesaver labs calendar, making it that much easier to remember, and that much harder to fabulously screw-up. Birthdays are also so much easier to remember, and if You're worried abaout always having Your Birthday on a Tuesday, just start the custom of scheduling the bigger party for the weekend after. That's right — party like its Your Birthday twice: once on Your Birthday, and again for the larger party⁵ on the Weekend. It's not like You don't already do that anyway. 

The Watercaust Memorial will always fall on a "Tuesday"
---------------------------------------------------------
Hholidays like Martin Luther King Day in the U|S⁺ stop moving around erratically like a holiday chicken with its head cut off. Who can actually keep track of the MLK Days? Jan 20, Jan 17, Jan 19, Jan 22, Jan... this is all way too confusing for planning, and makes event planners and graphic designers and organizers and civic associations and venues and businesses and attendees go MAD each Year having to update the date each Year. With lifesaver labs calendar, You can set that to either the third Sunday in January or better Yet, the Familyday of January, which is always going to be the 15th or 18th, respectively⁵. Always. So, every January 18th, forever, will be MLK Day⁵. Done. Normally Wednesdays are called Friendsdays, but there's an exception: the 18th is Familyday. So MLK, if it's scheduled for the Wednesday rather than the Monday, will be on Familyday⁵. In the U|S⁺, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is scheduled for the First Familyday⁵. Wei can all remember that, and each Nacion can assign its own Nacional Centrist, Centripetal Figure to the First Familyday⁵. Not some facist military killer.. a hharmless and religious civil resister, i would propose. A Family⁵ Authorship that is known to have righteously resist.ed⁺ state controls. Over the Decades, over the Centuries, it's one of the most important choices wei can set into place as a family⁵ and Family⁵ bulwark defining the proper Roles and Rules of Government. 

December 24th, Boxing Day, the IntEranacional Watercaust, is on a 24th, so it will always be remembered on a Tuesday.  September 11th will always be remembered on a Wednesday. If Friday the 13th is a Friday, then the 11th, which is two days earlier, is definitely going to be a Friendsday, aka Wednesday. See how that works?

Can Anyone Tell Me Y⁵  We Still Celebrate Tiw's Day? Why does the Norse God of Single Combat, Victory, and Heroic Glory have a Primetime Self-Promoting spot on Our Calendar Cycle? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Calendar is Consistent with All Known Religious Faiths. The Gregorian, Julian Calendar is not consistent with all known Faiths.. it's riddled with long-retired Paganisms. No one worships Woden or Tiw anymore. No one. No one worships Augustus Caesar or Julius Caesar anymore, either. The lifesaver labs Calendar Releases Namespace last taken by the vanities of Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar. Do You have a brilliant idea for a Month or a Weekday? What would You call the Leap Week, the Gift Week? There are at least 20 of 22 Major Nomic Naming Contests organized in three Major Entry Categories (Weekday Nomic Naming, Month Nomic Naming, and Special Occasions Nomic).  

Let's Reharness the Priming Effects!
------------------------------
Each Label can be connected to a [Franklin-like Ancient and Modern Blend of Calendrical Aims, Virtues, and Interdisciplines of Mind][Franklin Calendar]. Are You familiar with ["Priming Effects"][priming_effects] in CORE? It appears in Psychology, "Virtue Cycles", Education⁺ Economics, Religious Prophetic Thought (including ☾almunity⁵ Achievements toward Interreligious and Ᏼranch Diverse "☾alm and Confidence Forever"), Pace Design, Choice Forecasting, and frankly, Almost All Questions of Choice Architexture. How Y⁵ou are primed will determine more than You might suspect about how You'll behave. 

You see, back in Norse Times, on Tiw's Day, everyone was thinking about Single Combat. That's when the Single Combats would happen, more likely than not relative to all other days. That's when the Norse got out their throwing spears and halberds.. which were perhaps not halberds, as they were called "atgeirs", apparently. On Woden's Day, the Norse, et. al. were thinking about all the Aspects of Odin, and were bringing Odin into the World on Woden's Day. Now that the Weekdays carry no active descriptive, slightly-magnetized-prescriptive meaning to us, Wei're not entering into (or more importantly, preventing) Combat on Tiw's Day, which We confusingly now call Tuesday.  isay confusingly, because it means absolutely nothing any longer, and Yet we repeat this word billions of times a day, rather than packing a teaching or health reminder in that practically free planning slot for widespread priming effects. With a 13 Month Calendar, all these Names (all of them) can come under reconsideration. 

And the Names should come under reconsideration.. because the Effects could be Epically Tidal. Don't trust me to make that determination? Ask Dan Ariely⁵, of "Upside of Irrationality⁵" Fame. Dan Ariely⁵ will break it down for Y⁵ou. Anyone who's read Dan Ariely⁵'s Work, or the Work of Dan Ariely⁵'s Colleagues upon which much of the Teaching Work attaches, can give You the lowdown on how surprising and pervasive these effects can be. It can and will boil up into Years Upon Years of Life Preserved. Lifetimes, truly, as long as the Selection Rules are written to Prefer, on Margin, a "Weekday Rite or Aim Name" that preserves and improves the present standing wave wei have on quality of life. Any constructive interference on Tiw's Day that Wei let thru is going to be positive. That's not the problem. The problem is finding the more and most positive constructive influences, and that takes Millions of Minds in Reflection to find the Best Interactive Nomic Option, teh one that sets off the Very Best Tidal Waves, and not just one mind thinking alone. It takes, at minimum, a Nomic Naming Committee with millions of schoolchildren thinking about how cool it would be if Monday were Gameday and Tuesday were Testday.. they don't have to be realistic to surface some great ideas. They can be playful, and with some rearrangement, turn into an extremely valuable contribution that might win the Region.  

Just having students thinking ahead on the Weekend that the literal Laundryday or Liftday, the day You Lift Weights | do Your Laundry, can have Massive, Recurrent Tidal Wave Effects on macroeconomic choices. The persuasivie essays on the topic, alone, will have a dramatic effect on rewording and reworking the way⁵ that students think about Priorities in Weekly Pacetime. Maybe Laundryday or Liftday is not a ☾almpetitive Name for the Weekdays against all other Altarnatives, but i can not assert that, not Yet. i have not seen the whole set of interactive options. If i were doing this at school, i'd try to illustrate a deeper point about the culture of the week with Comic Book illustrations, even stick figures, showing how this would change the conversation protocols wei have with each other, while balancing multiple days and priorities. 

In any case, even the worst constructive suggestions are going to do far more work than Tiw's Day, the Day of the God of Single Combat, and now that You have a Rather Low Starting Bar to Beat with Better Ideas, maybe You can find better options, that fit well into Abbreviations, too. Addressing a Mature Audience, two or three weekly family⁵ days to stick family⁵ landing would be not just a good, but a great, idea. There are other constraints to be aware of, that You'll discover with some practice and play on a School ∱cool Worksheet. Not everyday of the week can start with the letter B or R. and "Cleanday" might be⁴ a great idea for family⁵ (it is, Cleanday can definitely benefit from an ongoing "tidal undertow"), but how is the abbreviation (C) for Careday, COREday, Cureday (In Businesses, and for Sports and Other ∱team Tryouts, an unlabeled Cutday) affected? Can Cleanday truly fit on Care, CORE, Cureday? That's a lot of Cs to pack in, and they run the gamut of Health, Hygiene, and Education⁺. i'd be tempted to stamp an Hh in there, as i always do, for Health, hhome, hharmlessness, and hygiene, but i don't wish to be that assertive about such a sensitive thesis, and i don't want my prints on this thing. The last thing i want is some "layman Day". That would be atrocious. Even the notion of a C day makes me uncalmfortable, but so would an A or E or B or D or C day.. any day that touches on any of my initials, past, present, or will. 

Let's keep troubleshooting Cleanday, tho, just to see where this takes us. If Cleanday's C interferes with CORE, Care, Cure, can Cleanday be transformed to Pureday, or better Yet, Purity, understood to mean the comprehensive moral dimension of "Total Pathogen and Pest Control", and be abbreviated to P, while maintaining that C intact. "Let's meet on Purity ". i know this sounds toxic, because it touches on old analogies of reproductive purity and STIs, but that's just a very small corner of purity⁵, its politically pointy⁵ end. If wei set that aside, and consider Purity as a massive dimension of moral reasoning that is really important and hard to attentionally attend to, and one that y⁵ socioculturally today tend to, in relative terms, shirk their hhomework and fail to shoulder their burden with parity⁵ in Youth, Adolescence, and Adulthood, "Let's meet on the 10th" and "Let's meet on next Purity" will evaluate out as awesome, and get us thinking ahead about how to keep our Hhomeroom and Workroom Pure and Orderly⁵. 

This sort of Questioning Process is essential to optimizing the spread of Weekdays, and turning it into an easy-to-memorize and represent chain, ideally, of just one uniquely identifiable letter for each Weekday. Can You fit the entire Week into a row of 7 characters? 

In Path (PTH, Putonghua) 普通话, this looks like:

一二三四五六天 (i.e. 1 Day, 2 Day, 3 Day, 4 Day, 5 Day, 6 Day, Sun's Day)

In English, this has an extra "u", "h", and "a", and looks like the far more awkward:

S**u**MTWT**h**FS**a**

So far, the lifesaver labs calendar only declares this, keeping the Path as Placeholders until finer choices are made: 

R二三四五六B.  

How do You improve on that sequence? What conveniences and constraints will You encounter in the final elemental set output? What "Tidal Patterns" are You expecting it to set off? What's the better? 


The Franklin Calendar, Augment.ed⁺, Spruced Up, and Amplified For Always  
---------------------------------------------------------  
Together We Can Make a U|S⁺ - IntEranacional "Franklin Calendar of Virtues" With Renaming Contests. The "Franklin Calendar" of Virtues, it just so happens, [Numbers Up to 13][13_Franklin_Virtues], just like the "Open Namespace" Months on this Calendar. This becomes an Automatic Franklin Calendar with 13 Months and 28 Opportunities, in Each Month, to Become Healthier, Hhomier, more Hhouse and Hhouseholder, Better, Happier. i want to preserve as much creative space as possible on this Calendar. i would just __suggest__ two Months in English -∆  - Ænglish that have survived my most Exhaustive Search, the sort in which i spend weeks in revery with langauge with electric attachment to the Words that Select the Most, under constantly Refined, ever more Parametric and Perfect Search Rules, with no Expectation or Anticipation that these, at this Stage, in undergoing research by as many as 10 Billion Theoretical Max Be⁴ings, deciding this Question for not just One but Several Centuries, might posit will be Adopted. The Months, even less than currency names, can not change more often than every Century⁵ without throwing the students of Hherstory⁵. 

To demonstrate the value of these Two Month Nomic Samples, i will later release small Case Narratives to demonstrate how hhumanistic these months might help Us and All Be⁴, but exercise Your Imagination, in everyday n-counters' and You might see the sense of adding these or even better Wisdoms to the Calendar of Virtues:  
1. "Teaching": Abbrev. "Teach", "Tea";  
2. "Recycle": Abbrev. "Re", "Rec", "Cycle"

Teaching, Teach, Tea is going to be hard to beat, i suspect, especially over Summer Learning and its evil twin and imposter, Summer Learning Loss. Recycle may be as strong, but it's of and in the Material World.. it has a different Character and Feel of Cycling than Tea, Teach, Teaching Cycles. 

Have Questions? Ask, ask, ask. But also.. Make, make, make!
---------------------------------
You have many Questions on the Process of Conversion, and the Confusions that will come in the Days where Systems are "Pushed, Pulled, and Lock.ed⁺ Into Place." i have settled as many of the Broad Strokes as i can, and with the Understanding that too much dilatory debate can Unharbor this Work for 017, i have worked on it as Centripetally (in Center-Seeking, Central Accelerations) as i could to minimize the cost and improve the effect of the Change, over a Long-sighted Timeframe that, for everyone, will simplify to much less Work over the Years. 

Today, unlike in Ancient Times, a small number of Operating System Vendors can achieve a Calendar Shift on Our Present-day⁵ Screens, Laptops, Cellphones rather quickly⁵. Most Hardware Firmware can be upgraded or, when too costly⁵, phased back in. Implementation is best done within 350 Days, with Most or Many Systems Shifting over by 017-01月, or if those Deadlines Fail, within the Year 017, to lock New Year's Each Year to Saturday (the Proposed "Best Day"), and the Nobel Gas Progression (2, 10, 18) to the  一日,二日,三日 Progression, ending on Friendsday (the Proposed Nomic Calmunity⁵ Improvement Name for Wednesday). Sustaining Second System Effects for long will be frustrating, so a Concerted Phase-in would be Wise. 

The Other Details of the Implementation and the Leap Year Rules must be settled immediately by a Trust.ed⁺ Ruling Technical Standards Body⁵, with Code Driven into Codebases in a Lock-Step Scheduled Order, from Broad to Narrow Use. 

Please check the Print Design Assets for Guidance on the Conversion Year Mnemonics, which You can cut out and carry with You anywhere You go, and remix and readapt for any hhome and hhouse timespace-planning and -packing, timespace-folding and -unfolding environment You're in. More description will be forthcoming, some of which can be seen below. 

A Gift Worth Giving. Hhackers, Hhomemakers, Hhouses of the World.. Let's Hharmlessly Unite!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If wei "Yes, Wei Kant" this Problem together, collaboratively, it can fall into place beautifully with just the right people spending energy on the "biggest impact" calendar changeovers. Obviously, laptops and cellphones can be turned over to a local langauge flavor of the lifesaver labs calendar almost instantly, Worldwide. 

As for the Author, as You can imagine, just "selecting" and "mutating" the Calendar to this Point as an indiviedual has been a considerable indiviedual burden, taking hundreds of hours to learn how to frame this so clearly⁵. Were the Author a Legislator, this could be settled quickly with a Floor Debate, leading to a Collective ☾almunity⁵ Mandate, bridging over to the familial, Familial, Commercial, and Congressional Calendars. The Author is not in that Position, and is highly dependent on You to "pay forward" this  design time and help "Gift Forward" a Better World. To give You a sense of this, if this is Your First Exposure to the 13 Month Calendar, You're hundreds of hours behind me in Shared Investment into this Project. Sitting back and waiting for everyone else to achieve this for You is a recipe for technical failure.  You can, of course, and many no doubt will be bridged over with minimal to moderate change energy, swept up in waves of Kohlberg Commons Creative Contributions from those spearheading the concentrated sites of change. 

But please help get out ahead of the curve.. if You're in an Organization, start talking about how to push and pull Calendar Change thru for 017, and how to manage look-up and look-back into the Julian Records herstory⁵ and history⁵, as well, smoothly. The Author was awed and impressed to see 13 Month Calendars at the City of Chicago 2nd Police District Station, with red month numbers overlaid over each Month, allowing almost instant "LL³⁶, Pax ⇌ Gregorian, Julian" conversion while maintaining Personnel focus on the LL³⁶, Pax Calendar. The design was very impressive.. a few more Kohlberg Commons contribs in Code Base Libraries and in Print Media would help the transformation to a Perpetual Perennial Calendar flow forward in a truly sublime, awe-inspiring, miraculous manner. 

i'll keep working on this, and will probably put more time into the Conversion than most people, but i can't turn this Calendar into my Entire Life and my Full Time Job ... like lots of creative people, i have a dozen other things that i absolutely must do, and i can't throw hundreds more hours into this without seeing a groundswell of support to spread and distribute the Work really well, and not waste energy fruitlessly without a Congressional, Parliamentary "Bootstrapping Activity" Match for a project like this that requires it. i don't have time for Calendar Reform as a wishy washy hobby.. it has to be falling and locking into place within organizations that should care about the change, like [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), or it's not worth the time wei spend on it, which is currently coming out of the Balance of Time i would be spending on Sageconsent and Smartconsent, whose technical architexture, code-base, and staff calendar is made so much more expensive and complicated because of this ridiculous Gregorian, Julian-mod12 Calendar. 

So, Hhackers and Hhomemakers, Hhomes and Hhouses.. Children of the World, Let's Unite and Get this Job Done. It's a Gift Worth Giving to Each Other for the Upcoming New Year's Cradle. Running this forward, a Dv Standard that builds from here seems to be Among the Most Centuries-Altaring Life Monuments wei can complete for the New Year's of 017. 

Remainder 5 Confusion can't win over Remainder 1 ☾almunity⁵ Clarity⁵, can it?

##Code Repositories##

Code must be added in a plurality⁵ of langauges and frameworks to make the Calendar Transition as smooth and simple as possible, with upstream ecological change delta moved first by large, hi impact technical concentrationslike Wordpress, Tencent, Microsoft, SAP, Apple, Google at the Operating Systems Level, with Code Library Implementations for every Langauge being pooled into a common, calming, calmpetition repository to see with what quality⁵ and how fast wei can hit target.

Namespace Locks (20 of 22 Open, Reorderable)
---------------------------------------

There are at least 22 Major Namespaces in this Calendar, including the Name of the "Leap Week", "Gift Week" and the Name of the Leap Year Guarantee Cycle, which, if called Sabbatical rather than anything else, for instance, "Kohlberg ∱pace", "Nomic Rest", "Parliamentar¹⁸y⁵", "Legislative", could well Perturb the Protections against the Establishment of a Non-CORE Religious Tradition. 

####The Namespace includes:  ####
- Leap Week (Gift Week)  
- Leap 6, 7, 8 Year Sabbaticals (Senatorial, _Kohlberg ∱pace_, Doubleheaders)  
- 7 Days (1日, 2日, 3日, 4日, 5日, 6日, 7日.. with 1日 and 7日 assigned to Restday, Bestday); and,  
- 13 Months (1月, 2月, 3月, 4月, 5月, 6月, 7月, 8月, 9月, 10月, 11月, 12月, 13月).  


Only "Restday" and "Bestday" are Locked, to Prevent a Reflective Halt.

Again, at risk of being repetitive, the only Namespace that requires lock is "Bestday" (_Saturday_ | Sunday) and "Restday" (Saturday | _Sunday_), with priority order set by a Customer's Coinflip⁸. All other Weekdays, including the naming of Wednesday as "1, 2, 4 Friendsday" and "18日 Familyday". 

The best time for this Transition would be 017, in just 358 days from the time of this Writing, because the Lifesaver Labs, pax-m New Year's can be locked into a Nobel Gas Periodic Pattern of 2, 10, 18 falling on Day 1 一日, Day 2 二日, Day 3 三日, with the New Year being set to "Sunday" (Restday) at the Global New Year's on InterNacional Standard Greetings Time or Local Night on the Anatomic Times of the Global Cycle every Year from now on that way⁵, without any break in the Weekly Cycle. Valiant's Day will also thereby fall on Family⁵ Day (the Third Friendsday, the day we now call Wednesday, the 18D). All other Calendrical Celebrations can be rescheduled.

Is Bestday or Restday the best day for everyone to Celebrate New Year's? If the answer is to Host New Year's on Restday, Sunday, for the next 433 Years, let's do this. Otherwise, Wei'll have to suffer until 023 with this Calendar. Or until the first Bestday, Saturday Bridge, in 022.   

i see 017 as Our Best Option, and putting this off is a Recipe for Parkinson's Planning Failure. The Herstories are full of stories of Calendar Reforms going nowhere, for lack of the Wholly-Formed, Wellspring.ed⁺ Will to Stick to a Deadline on Gregorian, Julian-modified and a Lifeline on something built-off and built-better than lifesaver labs, Pax-modified. For Free-form.ed⁺ Reformers, let me save You some debate time. The Major Stability Gain is Destabilized if there's even the Slightest Change in the Cycle of Weekly Prayer that Undergirds Billions of Souls' Religious Faith. No one will suffer [Napoleonic Whiplash][Republican Calendar] in a shift to a 10 Day Calendar, or the insertion of days one-at-a-time, in anything less than week-long blocks, within the Progression of the Calendar Weeks.

World Commentary is not only welcomed but very proactively n-couraged! This needs to be done on an IntEranacional Level, of course, to reach stability⁵. 

⁸: For the Bestday, Restday Ordering, an even more divinely-driven "random pseudo-random" can settle the Bestday, Restday Order to National Institutes of Standards and Technology⁵ (NIST), IntEranacional Observers, et. al. Grades of Random Seed Randomness. Only after the coinflip, Bestday⁵ emerged as the Superlatively Best Culturally for the end of a Grinding Workweek, and that may be settled (or its opposite settled) in the Will without 50|50 Resort. My vote is for Bestday - Restday, reasoning this thru for any⁵ Population that expresses Anticipation for the Weekend and "No Special Committment" to Religious Ᏼranch Worship on the 1st or the 7th Day Adventisms in particular on this Nomic Naming Matter, which sidesteps ""Sabbath | Shabbat"" Controversial Namings of the Saturday (Saturn's Day) or Sunday (Sun's Day).
