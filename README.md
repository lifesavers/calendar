Do We Want A Mod 13, Remander 1 or Mod 12 Remainder 5 Calendar for the next 1000 Years?
========================================================================================

lifesaver labs, the Pax-modified Calendar, is a robust simplification of the Calendar that stops the swirling confusion of a "Remainder 5" Shift at the end of every Year, forcing unequal months, unpredictable weekday month kickoffs, and unstable anniversary⁵ memories. This Calendar is Consistent with All Known Religious Faiths, and Releases  Namespace last taken by the vanities of Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar for at least 20 of 22 Major Nomic Naming Contests, each of which can be labeled with a Franklin-like Ancient and Modern Blend of Calendrical Aims, Virtues, and Interdisciplines of Mind.

Please check the Print Design Assets for Guidance on the Conversion Year Mnemonics, which You can cut out and carry with You anywhere You go, and remix and readapt for any hhome and hhouse timespace-planning and -packing, timespace-folding and -unfolding environment You're in. More description will be forthcoming, some of which can be seen below.

##Code Repositories##

Code must be added in a plurality⁵ of langauges and frameworks to make the Calendar Transition as smooth and simple as possible, with upstream ecological change delta moved first by large, hi impact technical concentrationslike Wordpress, Tencent, Microsoft, SAP, Apple, Google at the Operating Systems Level, with Code Library Implementations for every Langauge being pooled into a common, calming, calmpetition repository to see with what quality⁵ and how fast wei can hit target.

Namespace Locks (20 of 22 Open, Reorderable)
---------------------------------------

There are at least 22 Major Namespaces in this Calendar, including the Name of the "Leap Week", "Gift Week" and the Name of the Leap Year Guarantee Cycle, which, if called Sabbatical rather than anything else, for instance, "Kohlberg ∱pace", "Nomic Rest", "Parliamentar¹⁸y⁵", "Legislative", could well Perturb the Protections against the Establishment of a Non-CORE Religious Tradition. 

####The Namespace includes:  ####
- Leap Week (Gift Week)  
- Leap 6, 7, 8 Year Sabbaticals (Senatorial, _Kohlberg ∱pace_, Doubleheaders)  
- 7 Days (1日, 2日, 3日, 4日, 5日, 6日, 7日.. with 1日 and 7日 assigned to Restday, Bestday); and,  
- 13 Months (1月, 2月, 3月, 4月, 5月, 6月, 7月, 8月, 9月, 10月, 11月, 12月, 13月).  


Only "Restday" and "Bestday" are Locked, to Prevent a Reflective Halt. 

###Open Nomic Namespace for 7 Days###

Again, at risk of being repetetive, the only Namespace that requires lock is "Bestday" (_Saturday_ | Sunday) and "Restday" (Saturday | _Sunday_), with priority order set by a Customer's Coinflip⁸. All other Weekdays, including the naming of Wednesday as "1, 2, 4 Friendsday" and "18日 Familyday". 

The best time for this Transition is 017, in just 358 days from the time of this Writing, because the Lifesaver Labs, pax-m New Year's can be locked into a "Saturday" (Bestday) Local Night or Global Matching Hour Cycle every Year from now on that way⁵, without any break in the Weekly Cycle. Valiant's Day will also thereby fall on Family⁵ Day (the Third Friendsday, the day we now call Wednesdaythe 18D). All other Calendrical Celebrations can be rescheduled.

⁸: For the Bestday, Restday Ordering, an even more divinely-driven "random pseudo-random" can settle the Bestday, Restday Order to National Institutes of Standards and Technology⁵ (NIST), IntEranacional Observers, et. al. Grades of Random Seed Randomness. Only after the coinflip, Bestday⁵ emerged as the Superlatively Best Culturally for the end of a Grinding Workweek, and that may be settled (or its opposite settled) in the Will without 50|50 Resort. My vote is for Bestday - Restday, reasoning this thru for any⁵ Population that expresses Anticipation for the Weekend and "No Special Committment" to Religious Ᏼranch Worship on the 1st or the 7th Day Adventisms in particular on this Nomic Naming Matter, which sidesteps ""Sabbath | Shabbat"" Controversial Namings of the Saturday (Saturn's Day) or Sunday (Sun's Day).
