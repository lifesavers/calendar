Let's Put the Gregorian, Julian Calendar in the Grave this Year
=======================================================================================

##[Only an idiotés][diccionario] would base their Solar Calendar off mod 12##

![lifesaver labs, Pax-mod Calendar](https://github.com/lifesavers/calendar/blob/master/webassets/KohlbergLL36PaxMCalendar.png?raw=true)


mod12(365)=5 or mod13(365)=1? Only an idiotés would base their Solar Calendar off mod 12, when they could mod 13 it instead. Mod 13 Yields Remainder 1; Mod 12 Yields Remainder 5. On the lifesaver labs Calendar, the 20th of every month, for the rest of time, will be the equivalent of a Friday. We won't call it "Friday", but it will always be a Friday. 



This is the Kohlberg Commons lifesaver labs (LL³⁶) Calendar, which is actually a rather light, dusted-off repackaging of the [Pax Calendar by J. Cooligan][wk_pax_calendar], with a hhandful of precautions and selection biases thrown in to lower the friction on a practical, relatively [thermokenethic][diccionario] worldwide adoption. There's a lot of great work and insight from the logic contests of the early 1900s that still hasn't been implemented Yet, and this is one of the highest ranking and highest impact when Adopted. Any Improvement in "Calendrical Episodic Memory⁵ and Planning Projection" can have an enormous effect. And if we follow the Cooligan Rule, with Leap Weeks every 71 of 400 Years (called Pax, by Cooligan), wei can Program the Major Strokes of the Calendar Immediately, without Further Delay⁵, leaving the Long and Short Labels for a Final Deliberative Decision Process. Let's just please not Program the Leap Week between Month 12 and 13, like Cooligan did. Let's just drop the Leap Week at the End of the Year. It's much easier, and if wei're going to be on a delay from solar sidereal at max by about a relative 3.5 days, the difference in putting it on the 7th Year after the 13th Month rather than after the 12th is not Material. 

Why⁵ wouldn't You want to be able to anchor each day of the month to a specific weekday?  For the next 1000 Years, do We / we really want to pitch our tent within the Calendrical "Base Camp" of Mod 12 when we can have the much simpler, far more memory-stable Mod 13 Pax Calendar as our Calendar's "Base Camp""?

i don't mean idiot.. i mean idiotés, as linked to public argumentative fitness. As much as i am hourly⁵ an idiotés myself, in this small respect, my admiration and appreciation of the sensible work of J. Cooligan and the other Calendar Reformers who built toward an adoptable altarnative, i think i've climbed up to the point where i can say something with Relatively Hi Confidence in Public about the Current Mod 12 Remainder 5 Calendar (the Gregorian, Julian-mod Calendar) as an unstaunched, always-bleeding economic and mnemonic injury⁵ to every⁵ hhuman mind, requiring constant vigilance and daily, weekly, operationally exhausting cross-monthly⁵, cross-annual reference data look-ups to surcome, when a shift to Mod 13R1 would Staunch the Memory Loss Problem at its Root. That's not to say that wei don't need a Host of Devil's Advocates to show the Gaps in Care in this Problem. There are some losses, here and there, in the shift, and some organizational uncertainties on the transitional sequence margin, and i am not certain that i know them all. i was surprised myself with the realization that Courts, for instance, will be continuing to do lookbacks for the next 10 Years on Julian Dates, with regularity, no matter what, altho Case Files can transition more quickly. Paper medical records are not customarily so sensitive to precise annual date sensitivity, but surgical history (surgical hx) lookbacks can go back 20, 30 Y⁵ears. But the benefits in the will are so strong in all industries and most critically, within all indivieduals, that i find it impossible to think that the 13, 13 Calendar (M13R1) won't win out over the MADness of the Gregorian (M12R5). Let me show You WY⁵.

Sunday the 1st, Saturday the 28th, and Friday the 13th, Forever
----------------------------------------------------------------
On the Julian Calendar, if i said to You, "Let's meet on the 20th next month", You and i will have to look up what day of the week that is.  Why? Why don't we know what weekday the 20th is next month, and the month after that, and the month after that? If the 20th of February is a Friday, the 20th of March and April and May should be a Friday too. But it's not. Y⁵ (by which i mean, why₁, why₂, why₃, why₄, why₅) do we do that to Ourselves when better options exist? 

Every 6th, 20th, 27th, and y₁es, y₂es, y₃es, y₄es, y₅es.. every 13th will always be a Friday. Always. Every Month will have a "Friday the 13th". Forever! 

And no, this isn't a joke. This is a necessary outcome of hosting the 1st on Sunday, the 2nd (He²) on Monday, the 10th (Ne¹⁰) on Tuesday, the 18th (Ar¹⁸) on Friendsday, Wednesday, and the 28th on a Saturday. For the 1st of the Month to be a Sunday, and the 28th of every Month to be a Saturday, Every Month is going to always include—forever—a Friday the 13th.

So, if Your friend or colleague or parent or spouse or child or boss says to You, "Let's meet on the 13th", You'll know that means Friday. If they say, "Let's meet on the 20th", that's a Friday. "Let's meet on the 19th" means Thursday. It doesn't matter the Month, it's a Thursday, because wei're on a Mod 13 Calendar now, and we're not letting Leap Days throw Our Weeks.. we're storing those up until wei have a Balance of 7 Days, and then wei're giving Ourselves a Gift.. wei'll call it Leap Week. Or Gift Week. It's up to You.. maybe You can find a better Name for it, with [Moral Nomic as a Decision Agent Concentrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic). Maybe it takes the form of a Nacional or IntEranacional Naming Contest Series on Television. Maybe it's fueled by a website or social networks. Naming Contests can flourish, with bets on which Names will be of the best humanitarian effect. But that's for later discussion. Th key is, You'll be able to say when You're available (or not) a lot more easily, without having to pull out Your Pocket Calendar to find out what day of the week that is. How many screwups happen in our lives because we don't have the dates tied down very simply to instantly recognizable and recalled weekdays? Especially near month's end, or from month to month, these wacky⁵ Gregorian, Julian "cliffhangs" keep throwing everything off. Wei're "used to it", but once You know what to look for, You see it everywhere.. all the artifacts of a Suboptimal, and frankly, by Comparison, Quite Bad Calendar Standard. The sort that only an idiotés would choose over Mod 13. Because with Mod 13...

You'll Never Forget Your Wedding Anniversary⁵, and You Can Celebrate Your Birthday Twice
--------------------------------------
lifesaver labs, the Pax-modified Calendar, is a robust simplification of the Calendar that stops the swirling confusion of a "Remainder 5" Shift at the end of every Year. The "Remainder 5" forces so much "week-to-week redshift" that we all suffer from analytically unequal months (28 - 31, deranging month estimates by as much as 10%), unpredictable weekday month kickoffs, and unstable anniversary⁵ memories. Your Wedding Anniversary will always fall on the same day of the week forever on the lifesaver labs calendar, making it that much easier to remember, and that much harder to fabulously screw-up. Birthdays are also so much easier to remember, and if You're worried abaout always having Your Birthday on a Tuesday, just start the custom of scheduling the bigger party for the weekend after. That's right — party like its Your Birthday twice: once on Your Birthday, and again for the larger party⁵ on the Weekend. It's not like You don't already do that anyway. 

The Watercaust Memorial will always fall on a "Tuesday"
---------------------------------------------------------
Hholidays like Martin Luther King Day in the U|S⁺ stop moving around erratically like a holiday chicken with its head cut off. Who can actually keep track of the MLK Days? Jan 20, Jan 17, Jan 19, Jan 22, Jan... this is all way too confusing for planning, and makes event planners and graphic designers and organizers and civic associations and venues and businesses and attendees go MAD each Year having to update the date each Year. With lifesaver labs calendar, You can set that to either the third Sunday in January or better Yet, the Familyday of January, which is always going to be the 15th or 18th, respectively⁵. Always. So, every January 18th, forever, will be MLK Day⁵. Done. Normally Wednesdays are called Friendsdays, but there's an exception: the 18th is Familyday. So MLK, if it's scheduled for the Wednesday rather than the Monday, will be on Familyday⁵. In the U|S⁺, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is scheduled for the First Familyday⁵. Wei can all remember that, and each Nacion can assign its own Nacional Centrist, Centripetal Figure to the First Familyday⁵. Not some facist military killer.. a hharmless and religious civil resister, i would propose. A Family⁵ Authorship that is known to have righteously resist.ed⁺ state controls. Over the Decades, over the Centuries, it's one of the most important choices wei can set into place as a family⁵ and Family⁵ bulwark defining the proper Roles and Rules of Government. 

December 24th, Boxing Day, the IntEranacional Watercaust, is on a 24th, so it will always be remembered on a Tuesday.  September 11th will always be remembered on a Wednesday. If Friday the 13th is a Friday, then the 11th, which is two days earlier, is definitely going to be a Friendsday, aka Wednesday. See how that works?

Can Anyone Tell Me Y⁵  We Still Celebrate Tiw's Day? Why does the Norse God of Single Combat, Victory, and Heroic Glory have a Primetime Self-Promoting spot on Our Calendar Cycle? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Calendar is Consistent with All Known Religious Faiths. The Gregorian, Julian Calendar is not consistent with all known Faiths.. it's riddled with long-retired Paganisms. No one worships Woden or Tiw anymore. No one. No one worships Augustus Caesar or Julius Caesar anymore, either. The lifesaver labs Calendar Releases Namespace last taken by the vanities of Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar. Do You have a brilliant idea for a Month or a Weekday? What would You call the Leap Week, the Gift Week? There are at least 20 of 22 Major Nomic Naming Contests organized in three Major Entry Categories (Weekday Nomic Naming, Month Nomic Naming, and Special Occasions Nomic).  

Let's Reharness the Priming Effects!
------------------------------
Each Label can be connected to a [Franklin-like Ancient and Modern Blend of Calendrical Aims, Virtues, and Interdisciplines of Mind][Franklin Calendar]. Are You familiar with ["Priming Effects"][priming_effects] in CORE? It appears in Psychology, "Virtue Cycles", Education⁺ Economics, Religious Prophetic Thought (including ☾almunity⁵ Achievements toward Interreligious and Ᏼranch Diverse "☾alm and Confidence Forever"), Pace Design, Choice Forecasting, and frankly, Almost All Questions of Choice Architexture. How Y⁵ou are primed will determine more than You might suspect about how You'll behave. 

You see, back in Norse Times, on Tiw's Day, everyone was thinking about Single Combat. That's when the Single Combats would happen, more likely than not relative to all other days. That's when the Norse got out their throwing spears and halberds.. which were perhaps not halberds, as they were called "atgeirs", apparently. On Woden's Day, the Norse, et. al. were thinking about all the Aspects of Odin, and were bringing Odin into the World on Woden's Day. Now that the Weekdays carry no active descriptive, slightly-magnetized-prescriptive meaning to us, Wei're not entering into (or more importantly, preventing) Combat on Tiw's Day, which We confusingly now call Tuesday.  isay confusingly, because it means absolutely nothing any longer, and Yet we repeat this word billions of times a day, rather than packing a teaching or health reminder in that practically free planning slot for widespread priming effects. With a 13 Month Calendar, all these Names (all of them) can come under reconsideration. 

And the Names should come under reconsideration.. because the Effects could be Epically Tidal. Don't trust me to make that determination? Ask Dan Ariely⁵, of "Upside of Irrationality⁵" Fame. Dan Ariely⁵ will break it down for Y⁵ou. Anyone who's read Dan Ariely⁵'s Work, or the Work of Dan Ariely⁵'s Colleagues upon which much of the Teaching Work attaches, can give You the lowdown on how surprising and pervasive these effects can be. It can and will boil up into Years Upon Years of Life Preserved. Lifetimes, truly, as long as the Selection Rules are written to Prefer, on Margin, a "Weekday Rite or Aim Name" that preserves and improves the present standing wave wei have on quality of life. Any constructive interference on Tiw's Day that Wei let thru is going to be positive. That's not the problem. The problem is finding the more and most positive constructive influences, and that takes Millions of Minds in Reflection to find the Best Interactive Nomic Option, teh one that sets off the Very Best Tidal Waves, and not just one mind thinking alone. It takes, at minimum, a Nomic Naming Committee with millions of schoolchildren thinking about how cool it would be if Monday were Gameday and Tuesday were Testday.. they don't have to be realistic to surface some great ideas. They can be playful, and with some rearrangement, turn into an extremely valuable contribution that might win the Region.  

Just having students thinking ahead on the Weekend that the literal Laundryday or Liftday, the day You Lift Weights | do Your Laundry, can have Massive, Recurrent Tidal Wave Effects on macroeconomic choices. The persuasivie essays on the topic, alone, will have a dramatic effect on rewording and reworking the way⁵ that students think about Priorities in Weekly Pacetime. Maybe Laundryday or Liftday is not a ☾almpetitive Name for the Weekdays against all other Altarnatives, but i can not assert that, not Yet. i have not seen the whole set of interactive options. If i were doing this at school, i'd try to illustrate a deeper point about the culture of the week with Comic Book illustrations, even stick figures, showing how this would change the conversation protocols wei have with each other, while balancing multiple days and priorities. 

In any case, even the worst constructive suggestions are going to do far more work than Tiw's Day, the Day of the God of Single Combat, and now that You have a Rather Low Starting Bar to Beat with Better Ideas, maybe You can find better options, that fit well into Abbreviations, too. Addressing a Mature Audience, two or three weekly family⁵ days to stick family⁵ landing would be not just a good, but a great, idea. There are other constraints to be aware of, that You'll discover with some practice and play on a School ∱cool Worksheet. Not everyday of the week can start with the letter B or R. and "Cleanday" might be⁴ a great idea for family⁵ (it is, Cleanday can definitely benefit from an ongoing "tidal undertow"), but how is the abbreviation (C) for Careday, COREday, Cureday (In Businesses, and for Sports and Other ∱team Tryouts, an unlabeled Cutday) affected? Can Cleanday truly fit on Care, CORE, Cureday? That's a lot of Cs to pack in, and they run the gamut of Health, Hygiene, and Education⁺. i'd be tempted to stamp an Hh in there, as i always do, for Health, hhome, hharmlessness, and hygiene, but i don't wish to be that assertive about such a sensitive thesis, and i don't want my prints on this thing. The last thing i want is some "layman Day". That would be atrocious. Even the notion of a C day makes me uncalmfortable, but so would an A or E or B or D or C day.. any day that touches on any of my initials, past, present, or will. 

Let's keep troubleshooting Cleanday, tho, just to see where this takes us. If Cleanday's C interferes with CORE, Care, Cure, can Cleanday be transformed to Pureday, or better Yet, Purity, understood to mean the comprehensive moral dimension of "Total Pathogen and Pest Control", and be abbreviated to P, while maintaining that C intact. "Let's meet on Purity ". i know this sounds toxic, because it touches on old analogies of reproductive purity and STIs, but that's just a very small corner of purity⁵, its politically pointy⁵ end. If wei set that aside, and consider Purity as a massive dimension of moral reasoning that is really important and hard to attentionally attend to, and one that y⁵ socioculturally today tend to, in relative terms, shirk their hhomework and fail to shoulder their burden with parity⁵ in Youth, Adolescence, and Adulthood, "Let's meet on the 10th" and "Let's meet on next Purity" will evaluate out as awesome, and get us thinking ahead about how to keep our Hhomeroom and Workroom Pure and Orderly⁵. 

This sort of Questioning Process is essential to optimizing the spread of Weekdays, and turning it into an easy-to-memorize and represent chain, ideally, of just one uniquely identifiable letter for each Weekday. Can You fit the entire Week into a row of 7 characters? 

In Path (PTH, Putonghua) 普通话, this looks like:

一二三四五六天 (i.e. 1 Day, 2 Day, 3 Day, 4 Day, 5 Day, 6 Day, Sun's Day)

In English, this has an extra "u", "h", and "a", and looks like the far more awkward:

S**u**MTWT**h**FS**a**

So far, the lifesaver labs calendar only declares this, keeping the Path as Placeholders until finer choices are made: 

R二三四五六B.  

How do You improve on that sequence? What conveniences and constraints will You encounter in the final elemental set output? What "Tidal Patterns" are You expecting it to set off? What's the better? 


The Franklin Calendar, Augment.ed⁺, Spruced Up, and Amplified For Always  
---------------------------------------------------------  
Together We Can Make a U|S⁺ - IntEranacional "Franklin Calendar of Virtues" With Renaming Contests. The "Franklin Calendar" of Virtues, it just so happens, [Numbers Up to 13][13_Franklin_Virtues], just like the "Open Namespace" Months on this Calendar. This becomes an Automatic Franklin Calendar with 13 Months and 28 Opportunities, in Each Month, to Become Healthier, Hhomier, more Hhouse and Hhouseholder, Better, Happier. i want to preserve as much creative space as possible on this Calendar. i would just __suggest__ two Months in English -∆  - Ænglish that have survived my most Exhaustive Search, the sort in which i spend weeks in revery with langauge with electric attachment to the Words that Select the Most, under constantly Refined, ever more Parametric and Perfect Search Rules, with no Expectation or Anticipation that these, at this Stage, in undergoing research by as many as 10 Billion Theoretical Max Be⁴ings, deciding this Question for not just One but Several Centuries, might posit will be Adopted. The Months, even less than currency names, can not change more often than every Century⁵ without throwing the students of Hherstory⁵. 

To demonstrate the value of these Two Month Nomic Samples, i will later release small Case Narratives to demonstrate how hhumanistic these months might help Us and All Be⁴, but exercise Your Imagination, in everyday n-counters' and You might see the sense of adding these or even better Wisdoms to the Calendar of Virtues:  
1. "Teaching": Abbrev. "Teach", "Tea";  
2. "Recycle": Abbrev. "Re", "Rec", "Cycle"

Teaching, Teach, Tea is going to be hard to beat, i suspect, especially over Summer Learning and its evil twin and imposter, Summer Learning Loss. Recycle may be as strong, but it's of and in the Material World.. it has a different Character and Feel of Cycling than Tea, Teach, Teaching Cycles. 

Have Questions? Ask, ask, ask. But also.. Make, make, make!
---------------------------------
You have many Questions on the Process of Conversion, and the Confusions that will come in the Days where Systems are "Pushed, Pulled, and Lock.ed⁺ Into Place." i have settled as many of the Broad Strokes as i can, and with the Understanding that too much dilatory debate can Unharbor this Work for 017, i have worked on it as Centripetally (in Center-Seeking, Central Accelerations) as i could to minimize the cost and improve the effect of the Change, over a Long-sighted Timeframe that, for everyone, will simplify to much less Work over the Years. 

Today, unlike in Ancient Times, a small number of Operating System Vendors can achieve a Calendar Shift on Our Present-day⁵ Screens, Laptops, Cellphones rather quickly⁵. Most Hardware Firmware can be upgraded or, when too costly⁵, phased back in. Implementation is best done within 350 Days, with Most or Many Systems Shifting over by 017-01月, or if those Deadlines Fail, within the Year 017, to lock New Year's Each Year to Saturday (the Proposed "Best Day"), and the Nobel Gas Progression (2, 10, 18) to the  一日,二日,三日 Progression, ending on Friendsday (the Proposed Nomic Calmunity⁵ Improvement Name for Wednesday). Sustaining Second System Effects for long will be frustrating, so a Concerted Phase-in would be Wise. 


Leap Year Rules
-----------------
The Other Details of the Implementation and the Leap Year Rules must be settled immediately by a Trust.ed⁺ Ruling Technical Standards Body⁵, with Code Driven into Codebases in a Lock-Step Scheduled Order, from Broad to Narrow Use. 


The Leap Year Rules of the Cooligan Pax Implementation are quite simple, and can be done in Our Heads with Practice.

    "..[A Leap Week].. every year whose last two digits make up a number that is divisible by six or are 99. 
    "Years ending with 00 have Pax, unless the year number is divisible by 400." [Wk³⁶][wk_pax_calendar]

So, let's practice. Here's four strings from random.org: 280828401(excluded string)810403206508450040. The excluded string is a random number that resembled "777772345". It was random.org, no doubt, but it was not useful for training. Wei want trainable randomness, not true randomness. Let's break these numbers down into two digit blocks and learn how to foresee the Leap Weeks, Gift Weeks, or, as Cooligan called them, the Pax. 

    Leap Year N = [6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 99]
    Training Set: 28, 08, 28, 40, 18, 10, 40, 32, 06, 50, 84, 50, 04

Try that out, methodically⁵.  Type out Your answers seperated by commas. If You want to confirm, check the Answer Key⁵ below.

Please check the "Print Design Assets" for Guidance on the Conversion Year Mnemonics, which You can cut out and carry with You anywhere You go, and remix and readapt for any hhome and hhouse timespace-planning and -packing, timespace-folding and -unfolding environment You're in. More description will be forthcoming, some of which can be seen below, some of which i hope will spill rapidly out into the World, after being better-organized and better-written, as this moves into Adoption nearer toward "Hhuman-readable, Machine-readable, Major Industrial Hub" Production Code. 


A Gift Worth Giving. Hhackers, Hhomemakers, Hhouses of the World.. Let's Hharmlessly Unite!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If wei "Yes, Wei Kant" this Problem together, collaboratively, it can fall into place beautifully with just the right people spending energy on the "biggest impact" calendar changeovers. Obviously, laptops and cellphones can be turned over to a local langauge flavor of the lifesaver labs calendar almost instantly, Worldwide. 

As for the Author, as You can imagine, just "selecting" and "mutating" the Calendar to this Point as an indiviedual has been a considerable indiviedual burden, taking hundreds of hours to learn how to frame this so clearly⁵. Were the Author a Legislator, this could be settled quickly with a Floor Debate, leading to a Collective ☾almunity⁵ Mandate, bridging over to the familial, Familial, Commercial, and Congressional Calendars. The Author is not in that Position, and is highly dependent on You to "pay forward" this  design time and help "Gift Forward" a Better World. To give You a sense of this, if this is Your First Exposure to the 13 Month Calendar, You're hundreds of hours behind me in Shared Investment into this Project. Sitting back and waiting for everyone else to achieve this for You is a recipe for technical failure.  You can, of course, and many no doubt will be bridged over with minimal to moderate change energy, swept up in waves of Kohlberg Commons Creative Contributions from those spearheading the concentrated sites of change. 

But please help get out ahead of the curve.. if You're in an Organization, start talking about how to push and pull Calendar Change thru for 017, and how to manage look-up and look-back into the Julian Records herstory⁵ and history⁵, as well, smoothly. The Author was awed and impressed to see 13 Month Calendars at the City of Chicago 2nd Police District Station, with red month numbers overlaid over each Month, allowing almost instant "LL³⁶, Pax ⇌ Gregorian, Julian" conversion while maintaining Personnel focus on the LL³⁶, Pax Calendar. The design was very impressive.. a few more Kohlberg Commons contribs in Code Base Libraries and in Print Media would help the transformation to a Perpetual Perennial Calendar flow forward in a truly sublime, awe-inspiring, miraculous manner. 

i'll keep working on this, and will probably put more time into the Conversion than most people, but i can't turn this Calendar into my Entire Life and my Full Time Job ... like lots of creative people, i have a dozen other things that i absolutely must do, and i can't throw hundreds more hours into this without seeing a groundswell of support to spread and distribute the Work really well, and not waste energy fruitlessly without a Congressional, Parliamentary "Bootstrapping Activity" Match for a project like this that requires it. i don't have time for Calendar Reform as a wishy washy hobby.. it has to be falling and locking into place within organizations that should care about the change, like [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), or it's not worth the time wei spend on it, which is currently coming out of the Balance of Time i would be spending on Sageconsent and Smartconsent, whose technical architexture, code-base, and staff calendar is made so much more expensive and complicated because of this ridiculous Gregorian, Julian-mod12 Calendar. 

So, Hhackers and Hhomemakers, Hhomes and Hhouses.. Children of the World, Let's Unite and Get this Job Done. It's a Gift Worth Giving to Each Other for the Upcoming New Year's Cradle. Running this forward, a Dv Standard that builds from here seems to be Among the Most Centuries-Altaring Life Monuments wei can complete for the New Year's of 017. 

Remainder 5 Confusion can't win over Remainder 1 ☾almunity⁵ Clarity⁵, can it?

Namespace Locks (20 of 22 Open, Reorderable)
---------------------------------------

There are at least 22 Major Namespaces in this Calendar, including the Name of the "Leap Week", "Gift Week" and the Name of the Leap Year Guarantee Cycle, which, if called Sabbatical rather than anything else, for instance, "Kohlberg ∱pace", "Nomic Rest", "Parliamentar¹⁸y⁵", "Legislative", could well Perturb the Protections against the Establishment of a Non-CORE Religious Tradition. 

####The Namespace includes:  ####
- Leap Week (Gift Week)  
- Leap 6, 7, 8 Year Sabbaticals (Senatorial, _Kohlberg ∱pace_, Doubleheaders)  
- 7 Days (1日, 2日, 3日, 4日, 5日, 6日, 7日.. with 1日 and 7日 assigned to Restday, Bestday); and,  
- 13 Months (1月, 2月, 3月, 4月, 5月, 6月, 7月, 8月, 9月, 10月, 11月, 12月, 13月).  


Only "Restday" and "Bestday" are Locked, to Prevent a Reflective Halt.

Again, at risk of being repetitive, the only Namespace that requires lock is "Bestday" (_Saturday_ | Sunday) and "Restday" (Saturday | _Sunday_), with priority order set by a Customer's Coinflip⁸. All other Weekdays, including the naming of Wednesday as "1, 2, 4 Friendsday" and "18日 Familyday". 

The best time for this Transition would be 017, in just 358 days from the time of this Writing, because the Lifesaver Labs, pax-m New Year's can be locked into a Nobel Gas Periodic Pattern of 2, 10, 18 falling on Day 1 一日, Day 2 二日, Day 3 三日, with the New Year being set to "Sunday" (Restday) at the Global New Year's on InterNacional Standard Greetings Time or Local Night on the Anatomic Times of the Global Cycle every Year from now on that way⁵, without any break in the Weekly Cycle. Valiant's Day will also thereby fall on Family⁵ Day (the Third Friendsday, the day we now call Wednesday, the 18D). All other Calendrical Celebrations can be rescheduled.

Is Bestday or Restday the best day for everyone to Celebrate New Year's? If the answer is to Host New Year's on Restday, Sunday, for the next 433 Years, let's do this. Otherwise, Wei'll have to suffer until 023 with this Calendar. Or until the first Bestday, Saturday Bridge, in 022.   

i see 017 as Our Best Option, and putting this off is a Recipe for Parkinson's Planning Failure. The Herstories are full of stories of Calendar Reforms going nowhere, for lack of the Wholly-Formed, Wellspring.ed⁺ Will to Stick to a Deadline on Gregorian, Julian-modified and a Lifeline on something built-off and built-better than lifesaver labs, Pax-modified. For Free-form.ed⁺ Reformers, let me save You some debate time. The Major Stability Gain is Destabilized if there's even the Slightest Change in the Cycle of Weekly Prayer that Undergirds Billions of Souls' Religious Faith. No one will suffer [Napoleonic Whiplash][Republican Calendar] in a shift to a 10 Day Calendar, or the insertion of days one-at-a-time, in anything less than week-long blocks, within the Progression of the Calendar Weeks.


Why Do Y⁵ou Care? Don't Y⁵ou Have Better Things To Do?
-------------------------------------------------------
Of course i do! i wish this had been done Years ago! But since it wasn't done Years ago, i'm looking ahead at Decades of Vmonth Event Planning, and i can't connect "Calendar Date" to "Weekdate", and that drives me absolutely nuts. Do You know what day Valiant's Day is for the next 7 Years? i don't. Frankly, with some recklessness, i will admit that i don't even know what Weekday Valiant's Day falls on this Year! And i'm planning all the time for Valiant's Day! So much of my creative energy is based around a natural, noble, necessary, +normal sychronicity of the Courtship Season, as anchored, in the English-speaking World, into Valiant's Day. No doubt, it's easy to say that i should know what weekday Valiant's Day is, but this is January, and there's no reliable, "fast-and-frugal" map from here to there. 

Whereas, with the Adoption of the lifesaver labs, Pax-mod Calendar,  i can say with absolute certainty that Valiant's Day will fall on a Bestday, on a "Saturn's day" on every Y⁵ear, forever. All 14s, all Si¹⁴s, will fall on Bestdays, always. And that's significant for me to know, because that means people like me, who have to avoid reactuating doped silicon wafers and ӛlectricity for anything but the most heavy-impact lifesaving, lifepreserving, lifecuring aim on those days, can't use ӛlectricity for their Valiant's Day Proposals.. at least not before sundown. So for us, until after L6, wei won't generally be able to watch, let alone interact, with any electronic screens attached to any Festivities or Proposals on that day, forever, unless it's absolutely essential to a life for us to do so, and that's a hard threshold for anyone but central organizers to cross. But the effect size, Y⁵es, can be large enuf.  That's an empirical reality⁵. And my sense is that the HhÅÆJ ⏣ Orthodox won't be upset in the least about being cut off from ëlectricity⁵ on that day, and will just be joyful for those celebrating the day⁵. The Valiant's Day Proposals of the HhÅÆJ ⏣ Orthodox can bridge either World, the World of Sabbath or the World of Bestday, by occurring before, at, or after sunset. What's more, this very knowledge, in advance, of a substantive difference in the Valiant's Day Proposal Form is a natural way of forming families whose members' ӛducation⁺ is consistent, consolidated, complementary⁵, and empowering in the Observance of the "Who, When, and How" Valiant's Day Mix. 

But it's not just Valiant's Day that matters for a weekday fixture. With VMonths, Wei'll have to work toward Recurrent Monthly Gatherings, [Themed Learnapalooza](http://learnapaloozachi.com/)), and Musical Checkpoints that lovers can look forward to, count upon, and plan around. Life is not lived in virtual reality⁵.. Wei grow in the real world, at Real life Campus | Neighborhood Events, Gatherings, and Workshops. There's also Scheduling for Ᏼranchwise  Confirming Events (and Logical Branch Loops, and also, sadly sometimes, Dowry Sacrifice Disconfirms). The days that mark that Progression of the 5 Ys is very crucial, and must be repeated reliably, or wei'll have to keep changing Our Dates each and every Year, and cooperatively scheduling around each School's and City's and xx, xx, xy, xy family's calendar with a Mod 12 MADness adding to the total sum of the "crazy" cofactor. Privately, i suffered thru this before with a Major Event Plan, and no one wants to spend even an instant of their lives reauthing and redeclaring, with each new class and cohort, a reminder that Vmonth starts on a Tuesday, then a Sunday, then on a Friday, then on a Wednesday.. Who knows how to do Mod 5 in 7 iterations in a row? We're just wasting a massive amount of time "Remainder 5 Cycling" and "Month-to-Month Butt-ending" all the design materials and "weekday == day-of-month" checksum expectancies that accumulated for the Year, when Wei could just improve the Calendar, and simplify scheduling so much that wei drop the need for exhaustive checksums. A transformative event designer ∱team, planners, Courts, Courtships, and Attendees might make, at most, perhaps, 4 Versions of the CORE Design Assets that take a lot of heavy-lifting to build aesthetically and prepare, and then Recycle them every 4 Years, and get down to business on Ethics and other Aesthetics, sloughing off and refreshing as often as Students want, but with so much less pressure. Every Year will bring something amazing and new, but the CORE doesn't have to be rewritten and redeclared each Year because Pope Gregory was constrained by the Julian. Event Planners can save their Posters for the next Year, rather than throwing them away, knowing that they'll have to hit a Remainder 5 anyway next Year. With lifesaver labs, Pax-m, in many cases, You'd just be able to save the poster, or issue a series of 2 or 4 with a Cycle of change a background image, and the Poster's Ready. You don't need 7+ different versions. It can get as hi as 8, 9, 10 days of event drift, easily, without a Perennial Calendar to lock down Events. And compared to the graphic design waste, the memory security, month-to-month "2nd of the Month inconsistencies", and the memory leak issues are so large so as to be determinative. 

That is.. assuming that You're hhuman or android. If You're human or android, the 13, 13 Mod 13 lifesaver labs, Pax-m Calendar makes more sense and forms so many readily recalled "bonds" that the reaction can be expected to proceed spontaneously, once the catalysts and some pacing, some activating energy, and some organizational orientations are achieved.

We're accruing technical debt all the time, and if wei just overcome the transitional technical debt on a Mod 13 Musical Marathon Calendar,  wei'll be able to Count the Calendar Asset for the Rest of Our Lives, and "Gift It Forward" to the Next Generations. 

016: Universal ("Need to Have") and Long Now Date Formats (Not "Need To Have")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U|S⁺ needs to come onto Universal Date Formats, eventually⁵, y⁵es? 

YYYYY-MM-DD. Or YYY-MM-DD. Not MM/DD/YY, which gets confused all the time with YY/MM/DD if You travel or conduct business at all across Dating Conventions. "Long Now Date" formats are strongly preferred, such as "02016", to emphasize long-term orient.ed⁺ reasoning, but can wei ☾almpromise with the Contraction "016"? It's up to Y⁵ou. The "YYY" Triplet Space is Both Open and Distinctive. 

wei can understand conserving the Universal Date Time short format of YY-MM-DD and long format of YYYYY-MM-DD, but please, if You're Building a System, either pad or let me slip in padding for an extra digit to pull the Outlook out to the "Long Now", 99999 AD|CE. It's become a Major Part of how i think. 

But this is best settled by NSIT, the IEEE, and other Standards-Keeping Professional Bodies. Healthcare workers can't be bothered to write any extra penstrokes. But Judges generally have the time to shorten 2015 to 015 or, on the opposite face, pad "15" with an extra "0" to reach 015, and even signify 02015, and reflect on the longevity⁵ of the effect that Judicial Orders can have on multiple generations of families.

Except for the implementation and transition, engineers likely will not have strong feelings based on their own routine taskload. Engineers generally work on nonroutine tasks, and withn processors, except in very rare applications, the memory allocated to a certain datetime, date, or timestamp is oversufficient and the datetime question is one of presentation logic, where it's simply a question of resu guest experience, assuming a preexisting ESS Altaration. The "second system" and "transition" problems are real, and on this, may constraint change to Standard, Preexistant Universal Date Formats, without "Long Now Æra" Remastering. But if Padding could be added sometimes in the Presentation Layers, that would be wonderful. It's truly⁵ helpful for thinking about the Long Term. 

Bonus Work: This is the Zed (000 or 0) Century.. not the 21st
-----------------------------------------------------
Since We're on the topic of Calendars.. Historians did such a disservice to the Teaching of History in allowing the Years 0 - 99 to be called the "1st Century, AD". That gets confusing, endlessly confusing, as soon as We start speaking of the 19th Century of the 1800s, or the 400s in the 5th century, or the 3rd Century comprising the 200s. Why⁵ the Offset? i should not have to do operations constantly to piece these Centuries in (N00s, "N+1"st Century) Languistic Forms together. i would venture that even Historians see it as an attentional wound. It's not impossible that Historians, History Teachers have done this operation so much, and do it so frequently, that it's like adding 1 and 1 to them, but they don't understand how many sentences their students jump out of frame on and how many encodings just don't happen while this notion of an "Offset Ordinal Century" is getting remeasured and reevaluated. Each time it occurs this kind of statement throws them off-track and into a calculation of what "16th Century" means. Intuitively, the 16th Century is the 1600s. But no, it's the 1500s, according to books, because rather than starting the Count of Centuries at Zero in the Zero Year, the Count was started at "1st Century" at the Zero Year. This is all with an unhealthy dose of anachronism, to boot.. no one was actually calling the 0 Year "0" (whether operating with AD or operating with CE) in the Year 0. This Decision to "Offset Ordinal" the Centuries is what leads to these mindbending dynamics anytime the Offset Ordinal Centuries are used, whether in BC/BCE or AD/CE. All the BC-AD⁹ Years are insanely confusing when mixed with Offset Ordinal Century Labeling. What Century is 234 BC? Is that the 3rd Century BC(E) or 2nd Century BC(E)? Or is it a matter that's decided by Your Neighboring Classmate's Overconfident (or Hesitant) Opinion?  

Having worked with whole and natural integer sequences often, the start point of a sequence of numbers can be either 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ..) or 1 (1, 2, 3, 4..) without throwing me and my attention. In fact, in preparing a sequence of numbers for a Programmatic Function, the Author finds it strange when the starting point of 0 or 1 is assumed by anyone else in the Conversation. Whole or Natural does not throw me.. expressing the Year Numbers in Whole Integers but the Centuries in Natural Integers is endlessly confusing, on a second, and often a dekasecond evaluation delay, and not a millisecond, level. This may seem like a small thing, but this can turn a student off to Herstory, if they keep getting thrown by these rather senselessly complicated transcription flaws which carry within them no added meaning or value. The 19th Century should be the 1900s. If it's not the 1900s, please say "19 Century" instead, to help keep them matched up. It seems like a small thing, but it's not. It frustrated me so much growing up that i would lose the trail of thought from time to time, and today, i can't keep pace with Herstorians ⇌ Historians with accuracy and precision without needing to "space out" to recenter.. and if it's happening to me, it's happening quite frequently to everyone else who has had less than Professional Levels of Practice. It's a 21 count, doubly indexed offset. Let's just change it to be clearer. The 17 Century is 1700s, and the 17th Century no longer exists, because it's too expensive to cognitively evaluate that index all the time, unless wei're living within it.  

As for this Century, if We call this Century the 0 (the Zed, 000) Century, and We commit to the Rule Proposed above, the rest of Herstory is going to be ever easier for students from now on to learn and remember in consistent Eras. There's going to be the 0 Int(Eranacional), the 1 Int, the 2 Int.. and the 2 Int will be the 200s. Wei are in 016 right now, in the 000s. Double coding Centuries to Years on an Offset is a fool's memory⁵ errand. It carries no real dividends, and it's just frustrating to keep track of across 21 different possible indexing sites, each of which has to be in very small fractions of a second, continuous with and with no interruption to the Herstory Teacher's Speech, classified properly⁵. Attentionally, it is far more conservative. Let's just retire the phrases "21st Century" and "22nd Century", and onward, and call this the Zed Century. 

It's a long overdue Herstory⁵ Correction to the Teachings of "Offset Ordinal Centuries" ("OOC") History⁵.

Bonus Work: Getting Rid of Railway Standard Time.. "The Local Anátomic Clocks" and "Globally Orient.ed Prime Time"

Needless to say, the Clock also needs some Work. 

SSC ▟ (Si¹⁴/O⁸W⁷⁴Tc⁴³B⁵, 14/874,435) is endeavoring to integrate Anátomical Time into Students Lives. It's healthier, and will help preserve Hhealth and Learning with better, sharper Steep Time Countdowns, Declarations, and Debts, and ☾almunity⁵ by sparking regular thought about the Lunch Hours (L, L1).

Hail Mary! Pass
-----------

i'm relying on hhomemaker and hhacker news, but i'm also relying on the Vmonths and Larger Technical and Craft ☾almunity⁵, as it self-organizes and self-assembles in Creative Creative Commons Authorships. This "lifesaver labs" inflection of the Pax Calendar is either ready enuf to reach the next phase and be taken over by better C³ Authors or there isn't anything that i can do to make it ready enuf to see it reassumed and run thru to the last mile by better, faster, stabler set of Kohlberg Commons authors. 

It's my belief that this is a Physical Necessity⁵, not only on the Grounds of the Physics of Stability⁵, but also on the Grounds of Civic Numeracy⁵. i'm throwing some 71 Yards. Will the Pass Lanđӛ? (It's at times like this that i wonder where J. Broglie is.)

Leap Year Answer Key: N, N, N, N, Y, N, N, N, Y, N, Y, N, N

⁸: For the Bestday, Restday Ordering, an even more divinely-driven "random pseudo-random" can settle the Bestday, Restday Order to National Institutes of Standards and Technology⁵ (NIST), IntEranacional Observers, et. al. Grades of Random Seed Randomness. Only after the coinflip, Bestday⁵ emerged as the Superlatively Best Culturally for the end of a Grinding Workweek, and that may be settled (or its opposite settled) in the Will without 50|50 Resort. My vote is for Bestday - Restday, reasoning this thru for any⁵ Population that expresses Anticipation for the Weekend and "No Special Committment" to Religious Ᏼranch Worship on the 1st or the 7th Day Adventisms in particular on this Nomic Naming Matter, which sidesteps ""Sabbath | Shabbat"" Controversial Namings of the Saturday (Saturn's Day) or Sunday (Sun's Day). 

⁹: Recently, the Author filed for a Name Change, and the initials on the Filing, if the Name Change is Granted, will work out to ÆĐᏴC. The altarnative, ÆĐᏴC, was considered carefully, but the sentence syntax, the message and the ☾almunity⁵ Protective need, is more clear as "Æve Đarius Ᏼranch Clay⁵man", which re:solves to ÆĐᏴC. The alignment with the BC-AD temporal spectrum is a musical "accidental". It was not a CORE intended feature of the Name, but accompanies the Ædam Đavid sequence. Bear in mind that to me, this Year is really not 015.. it's actually officially 5776. In my reading of Herstory, The Declaration of Independence was Signed on July 4, 05536, as well as on July 4, 01776. Many of Us in the U|S⁺ are raised under more than One Calendar. At this time last Year, in 中国上海, i was working regularly under 3: The 中国的 Calendar, The Gregorian, and the Ævereet.. and the Gregorian is officially bad, and the Ævereet is, Well, often confusing for those who don't get into the very deep details of the lunary⁵ cycles.
